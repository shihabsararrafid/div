                <h3 class="orange-color">2018-2020</h3>
                <p>Sherpur was then a sub-divisional town in the lap of the Garo Hill. Though culturally a bit
                    developed,
                    the rate of literacy of this small town was less than that of any other town of the country. With a
                    view
                    to uplifting the educationally backward rural population living in abject poverty, the then
                    conscious
                    section of the society felt a tremendous urge to establish a college at Sherpur, a name glorified
                    with
                    the name of Sher Ali Gazi, the great saint. Under the dynamic leadership of the elite of Sherpur and
                    the
                    selfless sacrifice of all classes of people, the long cherished Sherpur college came into being in
                    1964.
                    The new college started functioning temporarily at G.K. Pilot High School and was shifted at the
                    present
                    campus located at the heart of the town. In 1980 the college was nationalized giving it financial
                    solvency. The college, leading seat of learning in the region, has been maintaining high academic
                    standard since its beginning. Initially only Intermediate and Degree (Pass) courses were introduced
                    but
                    now it is fully flourished with fourteen honours departments and four of them have masters courses
                    also.
                    The college with its excellent academic performance has been contributing greatly to the socio-
                    economic
                    development of the country.</p>
